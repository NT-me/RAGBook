ATIGUED with anſwering the 
enquiries, and replying to the ob- 
jections of his friends, with reſpect to 
the ſingularity of his mode of life, the 
Author of this performance conceived 
that he might conſult his eaſe by mak 
ing, once for all, a public apology for 
his opinions. I hoſe who deſpite the 
weakneſs of his arguments will never- 
theleſs learn to admit the innocence of 
his tenets, and ſuffer him to purſue, 
without moleſtation, a ſyſtem of life 
that is more the reſult of ſentiment than 
of reaſon, in a man who imagines that 
the human race were not made to hve 
ſcientifically, but according to nature. 
The Author 1s very far from enter- 
taining a preſumption that his ſlender 
labours (crude and imperfect as they 
are now hurried to the preſs) will ever 
operate an effect on the public mind 
and

is inclined to hope that the day is be⸗ 
ginning to ap pro ach when the growing 
ſentiment of peace and good-will to-

ERTO NATURE, Se. 


1D we rightly underſtand 

the principles, and the true 

ſcope of IIindoo religion and le- 
gitlation, which are eſtabliſhed on 
the ſame bas, we ſhould find that, 
to the gratitude and admiration of 
the human race, few legiſlators 
can exhibit fo juſt a claim as the 
lawgiver of Hindoſtan. Of this 
B : VC 


bold pretenders to inſpiration, bet- 
ter known by the miſchiefs which 
| they have brought upon the human 
race, than by the wiſdom of their 
laws ; and whoſe names ought to 


ſound as odious in our ears as their 


dreary dogmas have been pernicious 

| | to the world—but with thoſe ge- 
3 nuine legiſlators who have adopt- 
ed, as the baſis of legiſlation, the 

* dictates of philoſophy and good 
| | ſenſe. 

But there is one article which 
diſtinguiſhes, from all others, the 
doctrine of Burmah, and which 
raiſes, above all the religions on 
the face of the carth, the ſacred 
ſyſtem of Hindoſtan, Satisficd 
with extending to man alone the 
moral ſcheme, the beſt and milde 
of other modes of worſhip, to the 
cruelty and caprice of the human 
race, every other ſpecies of animal 
have unfeclingly abandoned. So- 
vereign deſpot of the world, lord 
of the life and death of every crea- 
ture, —man, with the ſlaves of his 
B 2 tyranny, diſclaims the ties of 
kindred. Howe'er attuned to the 
feelings of the human heert, their 
affections are the mere reſult of 
mechanic impulſe ; howe'er they 
may verge on human wiſdom, their 
actions have only the ſemblance of 
ſagacity : enlightened by the ray 
of reaſon, man is immenſely re- 
moved from animals who have only 
inſtinct for their guide, and born 
to immortality, he ſcorns, with 
the brutes that periſh, a ſocial 
bond to acknowledge (1). Such 
are the unfeeling dogmas, which, 
early inſtilled into the mind, induce a callous inſenſibility, foreign 
to the native texture of the heart; 
ſuch the cruel ſpeculations which 
prepare us for the practice of that 
remorſeleſs tyranny, and which 
palliate the foul oppreſſion that, 
over inferior but ſellow- creatures, 
we delight to exerciſe. 
Far other are the ſentiments of 
the merciful Hindoo. Diſfuing 
over every order of life his affections, he beholds, in every crea- 
ture, a kinſman: he rejoices in the 
welfare of every animal, and com- 
paſſionates his pains; forhe knows, 
and 1s convinced, that of all crea- 
tures the eſſence is the fame, and 
that one eternal firſt cauſe is the 
father of us all (2). Hence more 
folicitous to ſave than the cruel 
vanity and exquiſite voraciouſneſs 
of other nations are ingenious to 
diicover in the bulk, or taſte, or 
beauty of every creature, a cauſe of 


death, an incentive to murder, the 


merciful mythology of Hindoſtan 


hath conſecrated, by the meta- 
morphoſis of the Deity, every 

ſpecies of animal. A Chriſtnah, 


a Lechemi, a Madu aſſuming, in 
the courſe of their eternal me- 
tempſychoſis, the form of a cow, a 
lizard, or a monkey, ſanctiſy and 
render inviolate the perſons of 
thoſe animals; and thus, with the 
ſentiments of pity, concur the 
prejudices of religion, to protect 
the mute creation from thoſe in- 
juries which the powerful are but 
too prone to inflict upon the weak. 


When they converſe, however, 
with thoſe of a different religion, 
the H indoos juſtify by arguments, 
independent of mythology, their 
humane conduct towards the in- 


ferior orders of animals. The 


dumb creatures, ſay they, were 
ſent by God into the world, to 
exerciſe our charity; and, by 
calling forth our affections, to con- 
tribute to our happineſs. We 
conſider them as mute brethren, 
whoſe wants it becomes us to in- 
terpret, whoſe defects it is our 
duty to ſupply. The benevolence 

which on them we beſtow, is 
amply repaid by the benefits which 
they bring; and the pleaſing return 
for our kindneſs is, that endearing 
gratitude which renders the care 
of providing for them rather a 


pleaſing occupation than a painful 


taſk. 


From our tables turns with ab- 
| korrence the tender-hearted Hin- 
doo. To him our feaſts are the 
nefarious repaſts of Polyphemus ; 
while we contemplate, with ſur- 
prize, his abſurd clemency, and 


regard 
regard his ſuperſtitious mercy as 
an object of merriment and con- 
tempt. And yet in ſpite of that 
inſenſibility with which the prac- 
tice of oppreſſion, and the habits 
of ſpeculative cruelty, have in- 
caſed our feelings, ſtill are we 
affected by the ſufferings of other 


animals; and from their diſtreſs 


are drawn the fineſt images of 


forrow. Would the poet paint 
the deep deſpair of the maid, from 
whoſe fide the ruthleſs hand of 
death hath ſnatched ſudden the 
lord of her affections, the love of 


her virgin heart; what ſimile more 
apt to excite the ſympathetic tear, 
than the turtle-dove forlorn, who 
mourns, with never-ccafing wail, 
her murdered mate? Who can 


refuſe a ſigh to the ſadly-pleaſing 
ſtrains of Philomela ? 


When returaing with her loaded bill, 
TH aſtoniſhed mother ſinds a vacant neſt, 
By the hard hand of unrelenting clowns, 


Robb'd: to the ground the vain proviſion 
falls; 


Her pinions ruffle, and low-drooping, ſcarce 


Can bear the mourner to the poplar ſhade, 
Where, all abandon'd to deſpair, ſne ſings 

Her ſorrows through the night, and on the 


boughs 


Sole ſitting; ſtill, at every dying fall, 
Takes up again her lamentable ſtrain 
Of winding woe, till, wide around the woods, 


Sigg to her ſong, and with her wail reſound. 


But here the ſons of ſcience 
ſport with the {entimentsof mercy; 
and why, with a malicious grin, 
demands the modern ſophiſt, 
why then is man ſurniſhed with 
the canine, or dog- teeth, except 
that nature meant him carnivo- 
rous ?—Fallacious argument! Is 


the /itnefs of an action to be deter- 
mined 
13 1 
mined purely by the phyſical ca- 
pacity of the agent? Becauſe 
nature, kindly provident, has be- 
{towed upon us a ſuperabundance 
of animal vigour, does it follow 
that we ought to abuſe, by habi- 
tual exertions, an exceſs of force, 
evidently granted to guard our ex- 
iſtence on occaſions of dirediftreſs? 
In caſes of extreme famine we de- 
ſtroy and devour cach other ; but 
from thence will any one pretend 
to prove, that man was made to 


feed upon his fellow men? 



Moſt unfortunately too for this 
canine argument of thoſe advocates 
of murder, it happens, that the 
monkey, and eſpecially the man- 
monkey, who ſubſiſts ſolely on 
fruit, is furniſhed with teeth as 
canine, as keenly pointed, as thoſe 


of man (3). 


Having thus briefly refuted an 
objection, which modern Wijgom 
has deemed inſuperable, I proceed 
barely to point out a iew reaſons, 
which ſeem to indicate, that man 
was intended by nature, or, in 


other 




other words, by the diſpoſition of 


things, and the phyſical fitneſs of 


his conſtitution, to live entirely on 


the produce of the earth. 


In the firſt place, growing ſpon- 


taneous in every clime, the fruits 


of the earth are eaſily attained, 


while animal food is a luxury, 


which the mayor part of mankind 


cannot reach. The peaſantry of 


Turkey, France, Spain, Germany, 


and even of England, that moſt 


carnivorous of all countries, can 


ſeldom afford to eat fleſh. The 


bar- 


16 | 


barbarous tribes of North-Ame- 


rica, who ſubſiſt almoſt entirely by 
hunting, can ſcarce find, in a vaſt 
extent of country, a ſcanty ſubſiſt- 


ance for a handful of inhabitants. 


The practice of agriculture 
ſoftens the human heart, and pro- 
motes the love of peace, of juſtice, 


and of nature. 


The exerciſes of hunting, on 
the contrary, irritate the baneful 
paſſions of the ſoul ; her vagabond 
votaries delight in blood, in rapine, 

| and 


and devaſtation. From the wan- | 


dering tribes of Tartars, the de- 


8 

; mons of maſſacre and havoc have 

N ſelected their Tamerlanes and their 

| Attilas, and have poured forth 
their (warms of barbarians to de- 


7 ſolate the earth. 


Animal food overpowers the fa- 
culties of the ſtomach, clogs the 


functions of the ſoul, and renders 


oy” n * % 


the mind material and groſs. In 
the difficult, the unnatural taſk of 
converting into living juice the 
cadaverous oppreſſion, a great deal 

C of

of danger 1s incurred (4). Far ?

| Pan, far other the kindly nouri-

By ſweet but irreſiſtible vio- 


lence, vegetation allures our 


every ſenſe, and plays upon the 


ſenſorium with a ſort of blandiſh- 


ment, which at once flatters and 
fatisfies the ſoul. To the eye, 
ſeems aught more beauteous than 


this green carpet of nature, infi- 


nitely diverſified as it is by pleaſing 


interchange of lovely tints ? What

more grateful to the ſmell, more 
ſtimulous of appetite, than this 
collected fragrance that flows from 
a world of various perfumes? Can

equal the native flavours of Po- 
mona ; or worthy to vie with the 
ſpontaneous nectar of nature, are 
thoſe ſordid ſauces of multiplex 
materials, which the miniſters of 
luxury compoſe to irritate the 


palate and to poiſon the conſtitu- 
tion ?

And innocently mayeſt thou in- 
dulge the deſires which Nature ſo 
potently provokes ; for ſee! the 
trees are overcharged with fruit; 
the bending branches ſeem to ſup- 
plicate for relief; the mature 
orange, the ripe apple, the mellow 
peach invoke thee, as it were, to 
fave them from falling to the 


ground, from dropping into cor- 


ruption. They will ſmile in thy

From the practice of ſlaughter-

This our forefathers perfectly un-

er 



Had nature intended man an 
animal of prey, would ſhe in his 
breaſt have implanted an inſtinct 
ſo adverſe to her purpoſe? Could 
ſhe mean that the human race 
ſhould eat their food with com- 
punction and regret; that every 
morſel ſhould be purchaſed with a 
pang, and every meal of man im- 
poiſoned with remorſe? Would 
Nature, with the milk of kindneſs, 
have filled a boſom which unſeel- 
ing ferocity ſhould inflame? Would 
ſhe not rather, in order to enable 
him to brave the piercing cries of 


an guiſh, 



1-48-71 


anguiſh, have wrapt, in ribs of 


braſs, his ruthleſs heart ; and, with 
Iron entrails, have armed him to 
grind, without remorſe, the palpi- 
tating limbs of agonizing life ? 
But has Nature wing'd, with 
fleetneſs, the feet of man, to over- 
take the flying prey? and where 
are his fangs to tear aſunder the 
creatures deſtined for his food ? 
Glares in his eye-ball the luſt of 
carnage? Does he ſcent afar the 
footſteps of his victim? Does 
his ſoul pant for the feaſt of 
blood? Is the boſom of man 


D 2 the 

the rugged abode of bloody 
thoughts; and from their den of 
death ruſh forth, at fight of other 
animals, his rapacious defires to 


flay, to mangle, to devour ? 


But come, ye men of ſcientific 
ſubtilty, approach and examine 
with attention this dead body. 
It was late a playful fawn, which, 
ſkipping and bounding on the bo- 
ſom of parent earth, awoke, in the 
ſoul of the feeling obſerver, a thou- 
ſand tender emotions. But the but- 
chcr's knife hath laid low the de- 

light

light of a fond dam, and the dar- 


ling of nature is now ſtretched in 
gore upon the ground. Approach, 
I ſay, ye men of ſcientific ſubtilty, 
and tell me, tell me, does this 
ghaſtly ſpectacle whet your appe- 
tite? Delights your eyes the ſight 
of blood? Is the ſteam of gore 
grateful to your noſtrils, or pleaſ- 
ing to the touch, the icy ribs of 
death? But why turn ye with 
abhorrence? Do you then yield 
to the combined evidence of your 
ſenſes, to the teſtimony of con- 
ſcience and common ſenſe; or 





with a ſpecies of rhetoric, pitiful 


as it 1s perverſe, will you ſtill per- 
ſiſt in your endeavour to perſuade 
us, that to murder an innocent 
animal, is not cruel nor unjuſt; 
and that to feed upon a corple, 18 
neither filthy nor unfit?

the Hindoos, whom, in moſt of 
their opinions and cuſtoms, they 
reſembled, were the Aborigenes 
of the Canary or Happy Iflands 
(happy, indeed, it innocence and 
happineſs be the ſame!) If their 

E parched

parched fields demanded the re- 
freſhing dew of heaven; or, if de- 
luged with rain, they required the 
drying ardour of the ſun, the 
ſimple Guanchos conducted their 
cattle to a place appointed, and 
ſevering the young ones from their 
dams, they raiſed a general bleating 
in the flock, whoſe cries, they 
believed, had power to move the 
ALMIGHTY GooD to hear their 
ſupplication, and to grant their re- 
queſt (9). And who, with a 
beneficent being to intercede, ſo 
fit as thoſe innocent animals? To 


a God 


A 
a God of love, how much more 
acceptable the prayers of the hu- 
mane Guanchos, mingled with 
the plaintive cries of their guileleſs 
mediators ; how much more mov- 
ing, I ſay, their innocent ſupplica- 
tion, than the ruffian petitions of 
thoſe execrable Arabs, who, im- 
ploring mercy,perpetrated murder, 
and embrued in the blood of 
agonizing innocence, their hands 
holding up, dared to beſeech thy 


compaſſion, thou common father 


of all that breathe the breath of life !

The veſtiges of that amiable 
ſympathy which, even in this de- 
generate age are ſtill viſible, ſtrongly 
indicate the cordial harmony which, 
in the age of innocence, ſubſiſted 


between man and the lower orders 


of life. 


Man, in a ſtate of nature, is not, 
apparently, much ſuperior to other 
animals. His organiſation is, no 
doubt, extremely happy; but then 
the dexterity of his figure is coun- 
ter poiſed by great advantages in 


other creatures. Inferior to the

ere, a feature which he bears in 


common with the monkey, could 


ſcarcely have inſpired him with 
thoſe haughty and magnificent 
ideas, which the pride of human 


refinement thence endeavours to 


deduce (10). Expoſed, like his 


fellow-creatures, to the injuries of 
the air; urged to action by the 
ſame phyſical neceſſities; ſuſcep-

tuated by the ſame paſſions; and, 


equally ſubject to the pains of

diſeaſe, and to the pangs of diſſolu- 


tion, the ſimple ſavage never dreamt 
that his nature was ſo much more 
noble, or that he drew his origin 
from a purer ſource, or more 
remote than the animals in whom 
he ſaw a reſemblance ſo com- 
pleat. Nor were the ſimple 
ſounds, by which he expreſſed 
the fingleneſs of his heart, at all 
fitted to flatter him into that 
fond ſenſe of ſuperiority over the 
creatures, whom the faſtidious in- 
ſolence of cultivated ages abſurdly 
ſtyles mute. I fay, abſurdly ſtyles

can that name be applied, for 
example, to the little ſyrens of the 
grove, to whom nature has granted 
the ſtrains of raviſhment, the ſoul 
of ſong? thoſe charming warblers 
who pour forth, with a moving 
melody which human ingenuity 
vies with in vain, their loves, their 
anxiety, their woes. In the ar- 
dour and delicacy of his amorous 
expreſſions, can the moſt impaſſi-

various affections? Admire we

moſt eloquent in man, the tremor 
of deſire, the tear of diſtreſs (11), 
the piercing cry of anguiſh, the , 
pity-pleading look, expreſſions 
that ſpeak the ſoul with a feeling 
which 


which words are feeble to con- 
vey (12)? 


From likeneſs mutual love pro- 


ceeded ; and mutual love, in the 
bonds of ſociety with man, the 
milder and more congenial animals 
united. Amply repaid by the fleecy 
warmth of the lamb, by the rich, 
the ſalubrious libations of the cow, 
was that protection which the 
foſtering care of the human race 


afforded to the cattle of the field. 


Sometimes too, a tie ſtill more 
tender, cemented the friendſhip 


between

between man and other animals. 
Infants, in the earlier ages of the 
world, to the teats of the tenants 
of the field were not unſeldom 
ſubmitted. Towards the goat 
that gave him ſuck, the fond boy, 
the throbof filial gratitude has felt; 
and, for the children of men, have 
yearned, with tenderneſs maternal, 
the bowels of the ewe (13). 
Educated together, they were en-

Such were the feaſts of primeval 
innocence ; ſuch the felicity of the 
golden age. But long ſince, alas 
are thoſe happy days elapſed. 
That they ever did exiſt is a doubt 
with the depravity of the preſent

But that ſuch a ſtate did exiſt, 
the concording voice of various 
tradition offers a convincing proof; 
and the luſt of knowledge is the 
fatal cauſe, to which the indi- 
genous tale, of every country, 
attributes the loſs of paradiſe and 
the fall of man (18). Twas 
this dire curiofity that prompted 
Pandora to pry into the fatal box: 
this was the ſubtle ſerpent which 
prevailed on Eve to taſte the tree 


of knowledge, and hence, from the 


fields of innocence, were expelled 


the human race, in conſequence  - 



| of eating the forbidden fruit ; or, 


in other words, milled -by the 
ignis fatuus of ſcience, man forſook 
the ſylvan. gods, and abandoned 
the unſollicitous, innocent, and 
noble ſimplicity of the ſavage, to 
embrace the anxious, operoſe, 


mean, miſerable, and ludicrous life 


of man civilized (19). Hence 
the eftabliſhment -of towns and 
cities, thoſe impure ſources of 
miſery and vice ; hence aroſe pri- 
ſons, palaces, pyramids, and all 
thoſe other amazing monuments 
of human {lavery ; hence the ine- 


quality 

quality of ranks, the waſteful 


wallow of wealth, and the meagre- 
nels of want, the abject front of 
poverty, the inſolence of power; 
hence the cruel ſuperſtitions which 
animate, to mutual maſſacre, the 
Auma race; and hence, impelled 
dy perverſe ambition and inſatiate 
thirſt of gain, we break through 
all the barriers of nature, and 
court, in every corner of the globe, 
ſupremacy of guilt. 


The arts, as thoſe pernicious 


inventions were entitled, in one 




common ruin, involved with man 
the inferior orders of . animals. 
But to this atrocious 'tyranny 
which over kindred fouls we now 
exerciſe without feeling or remorſe, 
the human race were . conducted 
by gradual abuſe. For however 
ſevere the ſervices might be which 
man, newly enlightened, required 
from his former friends, ſtill he 
reſpected their life, and, fatisfied 
with their labour, abhorred to ſhed 
their blood (20). |

The laſt tie of ſympathy was 
ſevered by ſuperſtition. The ge- 
neral harmony of this ſtupendous 
whole is at times diſturbed by par- 
tial diſorder ; the beautiful ſyſtem 
of things which manifeſts the 
beneficence of nature, is ſome- 
times marred by fearful accidents 
that are apt on the mind of man 
to impreſs an idea of ſupernatural} 
malevolence. Aghaſt, trembling 
before the angry Gods, he made 
haſte his ſoul to redeem by the 
blood of other creatures, and the 
ſanguinary cravings of immortal 



appettte were ſated by the ſmoke 
of butchered ſheep, and the ſteam 
of burnt offerings (21). The 
horror of thoſe infernal rites in- 
ſenſibly wore off; frequent obla- 
tions allured the curious cupidity 
of man, and the human race were 
imperceptibly ſeduced to ſhare the 
fanguinary feaſt, which ſuperſti- 
tion had ſpread for the principle 
of ill. Bolder than the reſt, and 
more habituated to the fight of 
blood, the prieft, who was the 
butcher of the victims, which he 


offered to ſupernatural malevo- 


lence 14 


C99: 3 

lence, dared ſolemnly in the name, 
and by the authority of the Gods 
whom he ſerved, to affirm that 
heaven to man bad granted Very 
animal for food (22). So flat- 
tering to the perverſe luſt of 
his hearers, the impious lie was 
greedily received, and ſwallowed 
with unſcrupulous credulity. Still, 
however, with diffidence was the 
deed perpetrated: not without 
many auguſt ceremonies was the 
murder executed by the miniſters 
of the Gods; the Deities were 
ſolemnly invoked to ſanctify by 

F 4 their

their preſence a deed which their 


example had provoked; and the 


victim was led to ſlaughter like a 
diſtinguiſhed criminal of ſtate, 
whole life is ſacrificed not ſo much 
to atone to the. violated laws of 
ſociety, as to gratify the caprice, 
or to promote the perverſe ambi- 
tion of a tyrant. Yet even the 


venetable veil of religion, which 


covers a multitude of fins, could 


hardly hide the horror of the act. 
By the pains that were taken to 
trick the animal into a ſeeming

reluctance to the altar, that he 
ſhould ſubmit his throat to the 
knife, and expire without a ſtrug- 


ele (23): 8

Gentle friends, 

Let 's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully; 

Let 's carve him as a diſh fit for the 
Gods; 


Not hew him as a carcaſe fit for hounds ; 




And let our hearts, as ſubtle maſters do, 

Such was the decency with 
which at firſt the devoted victims 
were put to death. 


But when man became perfect- 
ly civilized, thoſe exterior ſymbols 
of ſentiments, with which he was 
now but feebly if at all impreſſed, 
were alſo laid afide. Formerly 
facrificed with ſome decorum to 
the plea of neceſſity, the animals 
were now with unceremonious 
brutality deſtroyed, to gratify the 
unfeeling pride or wanton cruelty 
of men, Broad barefaced butchery 




occupied every walk of life; every 


element was ranſacked for victims; 
the moſt remote corners of the 
globe were raviſhed of their in- 
habitants, whether by the faſtidi- 
ous gluttony of man their fleſh 


was held grateful to the palate, 


whether their blood could im- 
purple the pall of his pride, or 
their ſpoils could add a feather to 
the wings of his vanity: and while 
nature, while agonizing nature 1s 
tortured by his ambition, while

deſpot of every creature that walks,

air, on earth, or in the waters 
which encompals the earth. Thus 
the fate of the animal world has 


followed the progreſs of man from

his ſylvan ſtate to that of civiliza- 
tion, till the gradual improve- 
ments of art, on this glorious pin- 


nacle of independence,” have at 


length placed him free from every 


tender link, free from every lovely 
prejudice of nature, and an enemy 
to life and happinefs through all 


their various forms of exiſtence. 


But, famed for wiſdom per- 
haps at a period more remote than 
what we claim as the æra of our

barbarians, European or Aſiatic, 
and the conſequent. influx of vari-

congenial as it is to the gentle 


influence of the clime, and to 
the better feelings of the heart, 
bids fair to ſurvive thoſe foreign 
ſchemes of ſuperſtition, that trem- 
ble on the tranſient efferveſcence 
of that baleful enthuſiaſm to which 
they owe their birth. Diſguſted 
with continual ſcenes of laughter

better for the nurſe? There is a contra- 
diction in that.“ 




* One proof, ſays Rouſſeau, (Emile, 
Tom. 1.) that a taſte for fleſh is not 
natural for man, is the indifference which 
children manifeſt for ſuch meats, and the 
preference which they give to vegetables, 
fuch as fruits, &c.—lt is alſo certain, ſays 
he, that great eaters of fleſh are in general 
more cruel and ferocious than other men;

contrary the Banians, &c.”

variety of nouriſhment for human creatures,

curious bill of fare in Sir Hans Sloane's:

But the late ingenious Dr. Elliot, in his 
elements of natural philoſophy, as connected 
with medicine, has given us, I think, a moſt 
inconteſtable proof, that animals are not the 
proper food of man. In ſpeaking of fermen- 
tation, he expreſſes himſelf as follows: 

« Vegetable 


F 220 ] 


« Vegetable and animal ſubſtances only 


are ſubject to this proceſs (fermentation. } 


There are ſeveral ſtages of it, all of which 


vegetable, but not animal ſubitances may 


undergo.” 


« By fermentation the particles of the 


compound ſuffer a new arrangement, fo 


that the properties of the ſubſtance become 


different from what they were before.“ 


« If a vegetable juice of grapes for ex- 


ample be fermented, it will yield on diſtilla- 


tion, inflammable ſpirit, which the muſt 


did not yield before fermentation, This is 


called the vinous fermentation,?? 


« If 


HS) 5 
ce Tf the ſame liquid be farther fermented 
it will yield vinegar, which could not be 
obtained from the liquid before, either in its 
original or vinous ſtate, This is, there- 


fore, called the acetous fermentation.“ 


« The third ſtate of fermentation is 
putrefaction, by which the ſubſtance is 
converted firſt into a mucilage and after- 
wards into calcareous: earth; marine and 
other acids, and volatile alcali, which eſcap- 
ing with a portion of oily matter, occafions 
the difagreeable ſmell ariſing from putrefy- 


ing ſubſtances.” 


Animal ſubſtances can only paſs through 
the latter ſtage (putrefaction), and there- 
fore have probably already undergone the 
9 


former, 



former, that is the vinous and acetons 
fermentations,” 


Nou may we not from hence fairly con- 


clude, that the vinous and acetous fermen- 


tation are the means by which the vege- 


table is perfected into the animal? Putre- 


faction, the abhorrence of animal nature, 
the only fermentation of which a corpſe is 
capable, ſeems to be the means that nature 
employs to reduce a dead body, or rather 
a body diſorganized, to a ſtate ſuſceptible of 


vegetation, —Hence the circle ſeems to 


be—vegetation, animalization, putrefaCtion, 


and again vegetation. Hence the ſtomach 
has a double taſk to perform on a corpſe or 


putrefying ſubſtance, viz. to raiſe it to 


vegetation, and then to animalization. 


On 


1 1 
On vegetable ſubſtances the ſtomach has 
nothing to do, but to perfect the order of 


nature by bringing the vegetable to the 


next ſtage or animalization. 


(5. ) © I am perſuaded that all nations 
at one time or other have been cannibals,

and this worſhip was nothing elſe than a 
ſentiment of gratitude emanating trom the 
heart. Ridiculous ! ſays the Chriſtian, to 
worſhip brute bodies who beſtow this be-

the ſentiment of benevolence. Yes, but 
the ſavage feels and admires, and does not 
calculate nicely to eſcape from the demands 
of gratitude, —But if we are not to pay our

earth, to what then is our adoration due ? 


To an inviſible ſomething or nothing, which 


every man faſhions according to his own

naturally good, which you muſt undoubtedly reply, neither can he have any claim 


to our gratitude ſince he alſo acts from 


neceſſity.

the Gods, nor was there any poſitive law to 
prevent this, for it was forbidden by the 
law of nature. In the time of Pygmalion, 
however, a Phcenician, who reigned in 
Cyprus, an occaſion occurred in which it 
was thought neceſſary to redeem life by life, 
and an animal was ſacrificed, and totally 
conſumed by fire. Some time after the in- 
troduction of this practice, a part of the 
burnt-offering happening to fall to the 
ground, the prieſt picked it up, and burn- 
ing his hand in the action, in order to miti- 
gate the pain, applied his fingers to his 
mouth. Inticed by the flavour of the fleſh, 
and unable to reſtrain his eager deſire, he 
eat himſelf, and gave part of the ſacrifice to 
his wife. When Pygmalion was made ac- 
quainted with this atrocity, he cauſed them 
both 


137 1 


both to be thrown down a rock, and gave 


the prieſthood to another : the new prieſt 
ſoon fell into the temptation of his prede- 
ceſſor, and was puniſhed in the ſame man- 
ner. His fate, however, did not deter 
imitation, and that which was committed 
by many was ſoon practiſed with impunity 
by all.” —Porphyr. de Abſtin. &c.

rather the conſequence of famine or ſome other 
dire difireſs. Of all the animals that were 
ſlain among the Athenians, the firſt cauſe 
of death, fays Porphyrius, was either anger, 
fear, or accident. A woman for example 
of the name of Clymene, by an involuntary 
blow killed a hog. Her huſband, - terrified 
at the impiety of the action, went to Del- 
phos to conſult the oracle in what manner 
the crime ſhould be expiated. The Deity

To a certain prieſt who aſkgd permiſſion

account is alſo confirmed by Pauſanias in

« In the reign of Erechtheus, a prieſt of 


the name of Diomus having placed upon 


the altar of Jupiter Palieus an offering, 


conſiſting of barley and honey, a bullock 


happened to approach the altar, and put his 


mouth to the offering.“ 


« Enraged at the bull for taſting ani 
trampling upon the conſecrated cake, the 


zealous prieſt ſeized an hatchet and killed: 
the animal by a ſingle blow. No ſooner 
had he perpetrated, than he began to re- 
pent him of the impious action. He buried?

the bullock, and impelled by an evil con- 


ſcience, fled of his own accord to the iſland 


of Crete. Soon after the Athenian terri- 
tories were afflicted by a great famine. 
The Athenians ſent to conſult the Oracle 
of Delphos, with reſpect to the means of 
relieving themſelves from this calamity ; 
the Pythian prieſteſs returned them this 


reſponſe, © that there was at Crete an exile 


who would expiate their afflictions, and 


that if they would inflict puniſhment on 
the /ayer, and erect in the place where he 
fell a ſtatue to the /ain, that this would 


greatly benefit thoſe who taſted, as alſo 


thoſe who had not touched the dead. Hav- 
ing made ſearch for the exile mentioned by 
the Oracle, the Athenians at length found 


this Diomus, Who, thinking to take away 


the 


b1

the ſtigma and odium of his crime by com- 


municating it to all, told them that the 
city ought to ſlay a bullock. As they ſtood 
heſitating at this propoſal, and unable to 
decide who ſhould perpetrate the deed, 
Diomus offered to ſtrike the blow on theſe 
conditions, that they would grant him the 
freedom of their city, and alſo participate 
with him in the murder of the animal. 
Having agreed to theſe conditions, they re- 
turned to the city, where they, regulated the 
order of the execution in the manner in 
which it is ſtill performed by them at this 
day.

ſharpened, one man delivered the ax, an-

all thoſe that were preſent taſted of his fleſh. 
Having done this, they ſewed up the ſkin, 


ſtuffing it with ftraw, and ſetting it up as 


if it were alive, put a plough to his tail, and 


placed him as it were in act to till the 


ground. They then called before the tribunal 


of juſtice thoſe who had been guilty of the 
fact, in order that they might juſtify them- 
ſelves. The virgins who brought the water, 
threw the blame on thoſe who had whetted the 
ſteel ; they who had whetted the ſteel blamed 
the perſon who delivered the hatchet ; he 


threw the blame on the man who cut the 


bullock's throat, and the latter accuſed the

The dreadful calamities occaſioned by a 


great deluge, forced the Chineſe to feed 


upon their fellow creatures. 


« Les eaux yu Etoient pour ainſi dire 
arrivees juſqu'au ciel et elles $'elevoient 
au- deſſus des plus hautes montagnes: Les 
peuples perifſoient ainſi miſerablement. Au 
milieu de cet affreux deluge. . . . . . Je com- 
mencois par couper les bois, en ſuivant les 
chaines des montagnes : apres quoi Pey et 
moi nous apprimes aux hommes a manger 
de la chair.“ Du Halde, vol. ii. p. 301. 

In the ſame manner the natives of Cha- 
naan and of Meſopotamia were driven to 
the dire neceſſity of feeding upon their 
fellow creatures by a deluge which covered 

the 


[ 149 J 


the face of the earth, and deſtroyed the 


green herb which God had given to the 
human race for food. In this deplorable 
ſtate the children of Noah were compelled 
to lay their hands on the life of the cattle of 
the field, and God found it neceſſary to 
deliver to the Patriarch a new precept. 
« Every moving thing that liveth ſhall be 
meat for you, even as the green herb have 


I given you all things.“ Gen. ch. ix. 


ver. Jo 


Thus we find that nothing ſhort of the 
moſt conſummate, diſtreſs could compel the 
human race to ſubſiſt by the murder of 
other animals. Unfortunately for every 


order of life the horrid act of violence, 


ſuggeſted by a lawleſs neceſtity, had become 
L 3 by 


1 5 ] 
by frequent repetition an unfeeling habit, 
and the practice of deſtroying our fellow 


creatures ſurvived the calamity by which it 


was occaſioned. 


(23.) „ This being done, they made 
trial whether the victim was willing to be 
ſacrificed to the gods by drawing a knife 
from its forehead to the tail, as Servius has 0 
obſerved, to which, if the victim ſtruggled, 0 
it was rejected as not acceptable to the t 
5 gods; but if it ſtood quiet at the altar then 
| they thought the gods were pleaſed with it ; 
. yet a bare non- reſiſtance was not thought 
ſufficient, except it would alſo give its con- 
ſent as it were by a gracious nod, (which

Gen. chap. ix. ver. 5. | 


How did the Jews elude this poſitive 


command of a merciful God ? Why, they 
murdered the animal, and pouring out Ins, | 


blood upon the earth like water, deyoured 
his

his fleſh without ſcruple ; and they ſaid we 


have not violated the law, we have not 


eaten the fleſh with the life thereof, which 
- Is the blood thereof, for the blood we have 


poured upon the earth lite water ! 


© Thou ſhalt not eat the blood, for the 
blood is the life ; thou ſhalt pour it. upon 


the earth like water, Levit. chap. xvii. 


In the ſame manner © the Indians ( Ameri- 
can) through a ſtrong principle of religion, 
ab{tain from eating the blood of any animal, 
as it contains the life and ſpirit of the heart, 
and was the very eſſence of the ſacrifices 


that were to be offered up for ſinners.”

By wicked evaſions, and perfidious quib- 
bles like theſe, the Hindoos have alſo in 
ſome inſtances learnt to elude the pious and 


ſalutary precepts of their law. 


« Whenever a Hindoo has occaſion to 
croſs the Carramnaſla, or the accurſed river, 
which in the dry ſeaſon is fordable, he 
gives a Mahomedan a piece of money to 
carry him over upon his back, that his feet 
may not be wet with the accurſed river, 
which is a thing forbidden by their religion. 
In this and many other inſtances the letter 
of the commandment is obſerved, while the 
ſpirit of it is loſt ; for I think, one cannot 
doubt but that the intention of this law was 
to keep them within their own provinces.” |

(24.) © But the Bramins deny that any 
ſuch perſon as Brimha exiſted, which we 
have reaſon to believe is the truth, as Brimha, 
in the Shanſcritta language, allegorically 
ſignifies wiſdom, one of the principal attri- 
butes of the ſupreme divinity.“ 


Preface to Dow's Hiſt. of Hindoſtan. 


It has ever indeed been cuſtomary to at- 
tribute to the gods the more early efforts 
of legiſlation, and the firſt lawgivers have 
in all countries been confounded with that 
Divine WIS DoM from which their pre- 


cepts were derived.

To Mouſa (Moſes) that is Wispou, the 
Jews have alſo been ambitious of aſcribing 
their code of laws. At leaſt this is a more 
probable, as well as a more reſpectful con- 
jecture as to the perſon of the Hebrew law- 

_ giver, (ſince conjecture is all that remains 
to us on that head) than that of Surpas, 
who tells us, that Moſes was an old woman.
