Review of the Constitution of Great Britain. Great Britain's Third Edition, with Considerable Additions, by John Oswald.

... _ The opportunity to deliver some observations on the Constitution of Great Britain arose following the Petition of Mr. Horne Tooke to the House of Commons regarding the late Westminster election. The Managers of Coachmaker's-Hall proposed a debate on the following question: Is the Petition of Mr. Horne Tooke a libel on the House of Commons, or a just statement of public grievances proceeding from the unfair representation of the people? The author seized this opportunity to share his observations. _ _ The greater part of passages were erased from the manuscript of the first edition at the request of some moderate acquaintances. I have adhered to the same principle of moderation in this work, suppressing several facts and observations that might have provoked the zealots of the English Constitution. However, I cannot entirely escape the charge of violence. _ _ No praise is due to the great and good characters of the past, who led us from the star-gazing studies of the Greeks to the businesses of human life and the objects of moral action. _ _ Such praise is no less due to the salutary question that forms the basis of this evening's debate. This question wisely conducts us from the glittering track of metaphysical sterility to the more productive field of self-investigation. Know Thyself is the first precept of wisdom; and to this knowledge of ourselves, to a knowledge of our civil and political situations, a thorough discussion of the present subject will enable us to arrive. The question is not merely, Whether an individual named Horne Tooke has been aggrieved? but, Whether a great people are fairly represented and justly governed? Or, whether, on the contrary, they are abused by the mere weight of numbers in the representation?
